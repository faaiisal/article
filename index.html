      <h1>How to Build a Simple Chrome Extension in Vanilla JavaScript</h1>
      <p>Today, I’m going to show you how to make Chrome extension in vanilla JavaScript — that is,
        plain JavaScript without any additional frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.</p>
      <p>Building a Chrome extension doesn’t have to be difficult — in my first year of programming,
        I released two extensions, and I made both using just HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript.
        In this article, I’ll walk you through how to the same in just a few minutes.
      </p>
      <p>I’ll be showing you how to make a simple Chrome extension dashboard from scratch.
        If you have your own idea for an extension, however, and just want to know what to
        add to your existing project files to get it working in Chrome, you can skip down to the section on customizing your own manifest.json file and icon.
